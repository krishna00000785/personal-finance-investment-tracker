## V1

### V1 Architecture: Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

``` text
    This version focuses on the essential components to deliver basic user and financial CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality.
```

Core Components

| Component | Technology | Rationale |
|-----------|------------|-----------|
|Backend|Java (Quarkus)|"High-performance, low-memory footprint for efficient containerization."|
|Database|PostgreSQL|"Industry standard for strong transactional integrity (ACID), essential for financial data."|
|Security|JWT Token|Used for stateless authentication between services.|

## V2

### V2 Architecture: Target Design (Roadmap)

``` text
This version includes all planned services and introduces the Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) with Kafka, which is a major project goal and will require significant effort to learn and implement correctly.
```

Key Learning Topics for V1 to V2 Transition

|Topic|Rationale for V2|
|-----|----------------|
|Apache Kafka|Essential for implementing the asynchronous reporting and notification patterns.|
|Change Data Capture (CDC)|The mechanism to reliably feed data from your core databases (finance_db) into Kafka for reporting.|
|Polyglot Persistence|Understanding when to use different databases (like MongoDB for notifications) and how to manage them.|
